# GX2 - Website

This web application was conceived through a study project called Rocket Talents, in which I participated at the GX2 company. The purpose of this application is to put into practice the knowledge acquired about responsiveness and flexbox.

## Run the project

Navigate to the project folder and double-click the "index.html" file. Alternatively, if you prefer, you can also open Visual Studio Code. If you don't have the "Live Server" extension, I recommend downloading it. After that, using Visual Studio Code, open the "index.html" file and then click on the "Go Live" button located in the bottom right corner.
